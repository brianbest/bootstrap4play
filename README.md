Playing around with Bootstrap 4
===============================

This was a cool experiment to try out the upcoming release of Bootstrap 4. Comming down from the last 3 years of developing bootstrap websites for clients, I'm actually pretty suprised and pumped at the style choices for this version. The whole feel of the frame work has really lost its "bootstrap" feel. This I'm sure will cause plenty of developers to mown about having to now style all these bits they've never styled before however surely people are building theme files for this release as we speak. 

Anyway this file is just a short playing around with the new system. Not much else has changed from my perspective but still I only played with it for like 45 mins.
